### My portfolio / personal website.

A server side rendered site built with TypeScript, Svelte, SvelteKit, and SCSS. Hosted on Vercel. Originally built in vanilla JS; then rebuilt as an SPA in Svelte; and finally converted to TypeScript and SvelteKit.

### Somewhat notable features:

- Light/dark mode utilizing cookies and CSS variables (previously used `local storage`).
- Content is fetched from JSONBIN and Contentful.
- A totally sweet science fiction story.

### To do:

- Transition all of my content to Contentful.
- A proper 404 page.
- More animations, images, and science fiction stories.
- Make Code page responsive.
